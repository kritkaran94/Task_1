Details  :

This plugin has been developed using codeigniter. Codeigniter too is a MVC based framework, just like Magento. So, it shouldn't be a problem to relate to the code.


View :

site.php : It is the file we are dealing with which accepts the license from the admin.


Controller :


site.php : This class ensures the functioning of the form visible to the users.



javascript :


There is an external java-script file named file.js in the user guide -> static -> js section which stores the license of the admin and can be later used via the varibale jsvar.
